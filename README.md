I added new folders: scripts, json, css, font to make the project to be more organized.

I deleted form-no-js.html since this is for previous homework.

I also modified the experience to be generated by JS file similar to project-card, and I force them to be ordered by employment time.

For project_list.html, I added search feature allow user to search by name and select by tags. I also allow this page to check local storage of theme so it keeps the theme consistent across the pages. I refactored the theme JS code from formValidation.js so I can reuse it in separate pages.

Changed project description so it can fetch an array of description and maps to p tags of description to the html. The main page only show the first line of description, the project_list.html shows all of them.
